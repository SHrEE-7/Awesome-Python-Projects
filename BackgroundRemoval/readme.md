# `Background Removal` 

In this project we are going to remove the original background and change the background similar to the video calling apps like GMeet or Zoom.

To build the project I have used the following libraries and language :
1. `Python`
2. `OpenCV`
3. `cvzone`

We are basically switching on the video and displaying the original one with changed background one just like this :
